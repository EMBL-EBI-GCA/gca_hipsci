Documentation for how to run these shell scripts is in confluence.

You should use the [elasticsearch_files shell scripts](../../shell/elasticsearch_files)
and the [ftp_index_files shell scripts](../../shell/ftp_index_files) for the command lines to all these perl scripts with sensible command line arguments.

Files ending in '.es.pl' are for loading the files index in elasticsearch. Files ending just in '.pl' are for creating index files that sit on the [public FTP site](ftp://ftp.hipsci.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/archive_datasets/)
These scripts should get run whenever new data is pushed to the public archives.
